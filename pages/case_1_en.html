        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Context and challenge</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Although Sebrae already had a Design System in Figma and Storybook, the Empretec product required the
          creation of a new system, due to specific needs not covered by the existing DS.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          With the product underway and an intense routine of meetings, tests, and deliveries, the main challenge was
          to develop new components without compromising the workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-24">
          I identified inconsistencies and recurrent rework, which reinforced the need to structure a more appropriate
          Design
          System for the project's reality.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Objectives</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          In addition to concerns about aesthetics/layout, there is also concern about the efficiency of new components
          and communication
          with
          the entire team. <br>
          Therefore, the objectives are:
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Reduce rework and corrections </span> <br>
          ↳ Identify and create clear and reusable patterns to avoid rework, misalignment, and inconsistencies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Ensure visual and functional consistency </span> <br>
          ↳ Standardize components so that screens follow a unified language, even with different deliveries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Optimize production time </span> <br>
          ↳ Reduce repetitive decisions by creating a base of ready-made components, accelerating the design flow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Improve communication with the development team </span> <br>
          ↳ Document components clearly to facilitate handoff and avoid misinterpretations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Increase project scalability </span> <br>
          ↳ Create a solid foundation that allows for future evolutions without the need to redo components from
          scratch.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-32">
          <span class="font-bold"> Adapt the Design System to the product's specific needs </span> <br>
          ↳ Ensure that the system reflects Empretec's particularities, without exclusively depending on the generic DS

          organization.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                The existing Design System included five different fonts, which were not aligned with the Empretec
                Brandbook. <br><br>
                As the official font for the project is the Inter (not yet provided in the DS), I started creating a new
                Design System based on typographic standardization. <br>
                Previous fonts were removed, and Inter was incorporated as the sole official font. <br><br>
                To facilitate future adjustments, I created the typography variables.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Since the previous typeface family did not include the Inter font, the existing components did not
                follow the
                Brandbook guidelines. <br><br>
                After including Inter as the main font, and thanks to the structured componentization, it was possible
                to automatically update all components via the master component.

                In addition to typographic adjustments, it was necessary to create several exclusive components for
                Empretec,
                considering the specificities of its four modules (Urban, Rural, Arena, and Startup). <br><br>
                Each module demanded specific color definitions and some elements, however, headers, footers, inputs,
                buttons, among others,
                followed the same patterns, ensuring consistent visual identity and functionality in each context.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                The absence of Empretec's color palette in the DS required manual application of colors, copied in
                isolated areas
                in the file, which compromised the agility of the process and generated visual inconsistencies.
                <br><br>
                These inconsistencies, which occurred at times, were identified during tests or development, causing
                rework and affecting team productivity. <br><br>
                To solve the problem, the new palette was structured as variables in Figma and documented in a
                dedicated tab, promoting standardization, quick access, and alignment between design and development.

                After standardizing the master components, typographic inconsistencies no longer occurred during testing

                When these needs become recurring, a new component is created and integrated into the Design System,

                With the inclusion of the new color palette in variables and styles in Figma, manual application and

                The creation of centralized styles resulted in significant productivity gains,

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                The Design System was created in Figma because it is a collaborative, flexible tool widely adopted by
                the team. <br><br>

                Clear and centralized documentation in Figma reduced recurring doubts, accelerated handoff, and improved
                communication between
                design, product, and tech teams. This ensured greater visual consistency, time savings on deliveries,
                and better alignment in interface decisions.

                Although the Design System solved the main problems, it continues to evolve and adapt to new product
                demands. <br><br>
                As the product grows and new features are developed,
                specific needs arise that require the creation or adaptation of components, reinforcing the importance
                of keeping the DS as a living and iterative system.

            This project is a clear example of my commitment to creating design solutions that not only visually
            delight,
            but also deliver strategic value and tangible results. By leading the restructuring and improvement of the
            Empretec Design System, I demonstrated how standardization and consistency can optimize processes,
            reducing rework and inconsistencies, and improving communication between teams. <br><br>

            My approach focused on scalability and adaptability ensured that the system became a living asset,
            capable of boosting productivity and agility in the development of new functionalities,
            resulting in a more robust and effective final product. <br><br>


            If you are looking for a Designer who thinks systematically,
            collaborates actively and transforms challenges into success, I will be happy to connect and understand how
