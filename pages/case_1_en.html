        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Context and challenge</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Although Sebrae already had a Design System in Figma and Storybook, the Empretec product required the
          creation of a new system, due to specific needs not covered by the existing DS.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          With the product underway and an intense routine of meetings, tests, and deliveries, the main challenge was
          to develop new components without compromising the workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-24">
          I identified inconsistencies and recurrent rework, which reinforced the need to structure a more appropriate Design
          System for the project's reality.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Objectives</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          In addition to concerns about aesthetics/layout, there is also concern about the efficiency of new components and communication
          with
          the entire team. <br>
          Therefore, the objectives are:
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Reduce rework and corrections </span> <br>
          ↳ Identify and create clear and reusable patterns to avoid rework, misalignment, and inconsistencies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Ensure visual and functional consistency </span> <br>
          ↳ Standardize components so that screens follow a unified language, even with different deliveries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Optimize production time </span> <br>
          ↳ Reduce repetitive decisions by creating a base of ready-made components, accelerating the design flow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Improve communication with the development team </span> <br>
          ↳ Document components clearly to facilitate handoff and avoid misinterpretations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <span class="font-bold"> Increase project scalability </span> <br>
          ↳ Create a solid foundation that allows for future evolutions without the need to redo components from scratch.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-32">
          <span class="font-bold"> Adapt the Design System to the product's specific needs </span> <br>
          ↳ Ensure that the system reflects Empretec's particularities, without exclusively depending on the generic DS
          of the
          organization.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                The existing Design System included five different fonts, which were not aligned with the Empretec Brandbook. <br><br>
                As the official font for the project is the Inter (not yet provided in the DS), I started creating a new
                Design System based on typographic standardization. <br>
                Previous fonts were removed, and Inter was incorporated as the sole official font. <br><br>
                To facilitate future adjustments, I created the typography variables.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Since the previous typeface family did not include the Inter font, the existing components did not follow the
                Brandbook guidelines. <br><br>
                After including Inter as the main font, and thanks to the structured componentization, it was possible
                to automatically update all components via the master component.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                In addition to typographic adjustments, it was necessary to create several exclusive components for Empretec,
                considering the specificities of its four modules (Urban, Rural, Arena, and Startup). <br><br>
                Each module demanded specific color definitions and some elements, however, headers, footers, inputs, buttons, among others,
                followed the same patterns, ensuring consistent visual identity and functionality in each context.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                The absence of Empretec's color palette in the DS required manual application of colors, copied in isolated areas
                in the file, which compromised the agility of the process and generated visual inconsistencies.
                <br><br>
                These inconsistencies, which occurred at times, were identified during tests or development, causing rework and affecting team productivity. <br><br>
                To solve the problem, the new palette was structured as variables in Figma and documented in a
                dedicated tab, promoting standardization, quick access, and alignment between design and development.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                After standardizing the master components, typographic inconsistencies ceased to occur during tests and development. <br>
                This eliminated the need for subsequent adjustments, ensuring 100% utilization of the time invested in this stage.

                The componentization of on-screen elements significantly reduced errors, making them virtually nonexistent. <br>
                In specific cases (due to the continuous evolution of the product), it is necessary to temporarily de-componentize for specific adjustments. <br>
                When these needs become recurrent, a new component is created and integrated into the Design System,
                ensuring scalability and maintaining consistency.

              <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                With the inclusion of the new color palette in Figma's variables and styles, the need for manual application and the use
                of loose references in the file was eliminated. <br>
                The creation of centralized styles resulted in significant productivity gains,
                greater agility in accessing colors, and an almost total reduction in visual inconsistencies.

                With the Design System defined and Figma pages organized by theme (such as colors, typography, components, among others),
                communication became more efficient. <br>
                The clear and segmented structure facilitated access to information,

                Although the Design System has solved the main problems of visual consistency,

                it continues to evolve. <br>
                As the product grows and new functionalities are developed,
                specific demands arise that require the creation or adaptation of components, reinforcing the need

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-16">
            This project is a clear example of my commitment to creating design solutions that not only visually delight,
            but also deliver strategic value and tangible results. By leading the restructuring and improvement of the
            Empretec Design System, I demonstrated how standardization and consistency can optimize processes,
            reducing rework and inconsistencies, and improving communication between teams. <br><br>

            My approach focused on scalability and adaptability ensured that the system became a living asset,
            capable of boosting productivity and agility in the development of new functionalities,
            resulting in a more robust and effective final product. <br><br>


            If you are looking for a Designer who thinks systematically,
            collaborates actively and transforms challenges into success, I will be happy to connect and understand how I can help in your next project/product.
